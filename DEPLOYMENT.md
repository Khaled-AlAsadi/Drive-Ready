    | DATABASE_URL | ************* |
    | SECRET_KEY | ************* |
    | DEBUG | False |
    | DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1 |

    DATABASE_URL value is takes from ElephantSQL dashboard, SECRET_KEY value is takes from your local env.py file.


12. Open VS Code and create a new file called `build.sh` in the root directory of your project.

    - ![Create Build.sh](documentation/deployment/render_create_build_sh.png)

13. Copy the following code into the `build.sh` file:

    ```bash
      set -o errexit
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
      python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
    ```

    -*pip install -r requirements.txt installs the packages detailed in your requirements.txt file.*
    - *python manage.py collectstatic collects all static files to allow them to be served in the production environment.*
    - *The â€“noinput flag allows the command to run with no additional input from the deploying developer.*
    - *python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate are run to ensure all migrations are made to your production database.*

14. Save the file `build.sh`.

15. Go to `settings.py` file and add the following code to add Render.com to allowed hosts:

    ```python
        RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME = os.environ.get('RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME')
        if RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME:
            ALLOWED_HOSTS.append(RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME)
    ```

16. Save the file `settings.py`.

17. Go to `env.py` and change to DATEBASE_URL value to the one you got from ElephantSQL.

    ```python
        os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = '*************'
    ```

18. Create a superuser for your database.

    ```bash
        python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

19. Commit and push the changes to GitHub.

20. Go back to Render and click "Create Web Service."

    - ![Save Web Service](documentation/deployment/render_create_web_service.png)
